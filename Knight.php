    <h1 style="text-align:center">Knight and princess </h1> <br> <br> <br>
    <p>In a small kingdom bordered by dense forests, a young knight named Aldric was assigned to guard the castle's outer gates. One day, he noticed a cloaked figure slipping past the guards and out through a side path toward the forest. Curious, he followed, only to discover it was the princess, Elara, moving quietly but with a clear purpose. <br> <br> 

He called out, startling her. She hesitated, then waved him to join her rather than send him back. Reluctantly, Aldric followed, listening as she explained her plan. She was meeting with scouts she trusted, trying to map safe paths through the woods—a network that could serve the people should they ever need to escape a siege. Her father thought the effort unnecessary, but she wasn’t convinced, and she wasn’t one to sit idle. <br> <br> 

Over the coming months, Elara and Aldric continued slipping away into the forest, developing a quiet understanding and working in sync as they marked routes and studied the land. Their trust in each other grew, shaped by long days navigating the woods and discussing the kingdom’s uncertain future. Aldric saw her not as a distant royal, but as someone who understood the risks and carried the same sense of duty he did. <br> <br> 

One night, after weeks of silent trips and cautious planning, a skirmish broke out near the border. When Elara’s father ordered the castle gates shut to outsiders, it was Aldric and Elara’s hidden paths that allowed villagers to escape unharmed. They returned together to the castle at dawn, their secret work now well-known and quietly respected by those it had saved. <br> <br>
