    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Cowboy and his cowgirl</h1><br><br><br>
    <p style="Text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;" >Out on the dry, sprawling plains of West Texas, Jesse made his living by working the land and keeping his cattle in check. He wasn’t one for big talk or show, just a man who enjoyed the quiet rhythm of ranch life. But on one of his runs into town for supplies, he spotted someone new—a woman hauling bags of feed down from a wagon outside the mercantile. <br> <br> <br>

She was sturdy and focused, her brown hair tucked beneath a worn hat. She handled each sack of feed with a certain ease that caught his attention, and before he knew it, he’d walked over and offered a hand. She glanced at him with a calm, assessing look before nodding. “I’m Annie,” she said, her grip steady as they unloaded side by side. <br> <br> <br>

Over time, their paths crossed more often. Annie was new to the area, a couple of counties over, working a patch of land she’d taken on by herself. She wasn’t one to waste time on small talk, either, but somehow conversations flowed between them as naturally as creek water after the rains. They talked cattle markets, how to keep land from drying out too soon, and the best way to keep coyotes off. Sometimes, they rode together across the empty stretch of land that lay between their places. <br> <br> <br>

One cool, late-summer evening, Jesse was out fixing a fence when Annie rode up, nodding at his work before offering to lend a hand. They finished up together, the sun dipping low in the sky as they stood back to check their work. In the quiet, he noticed how they didn’t really need to say anything, and she seemed to notice it, too. <br> <br> <br>

Over the next couple of years, they worked through the ups and downs that came with the life they both knew so well. When drought hit, they kept each other’s spirits up, swapping water for cattle when one had it and the other didn’t. They kept their plans small and their trust steady. <br> <br> <br>

Their partnership just grew, no fuss and no big declarations. Over time, the sight of Jesse and Annie riding across the plains became familiar to their neighbors, two people whose respect and reliance had come to be as steady as the land itself. The folks nearby would say you couldn’t find a more dependable pair, and to Jesse and Annie, that was all there was to it.<br> <br> <br>
