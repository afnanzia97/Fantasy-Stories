    <h1 style="text-align:center">Dragon and a girl</h1> <br> <br> <br>
    <p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 20px;">Ellis grew up in a village that clung to the edge of a towering mountain, where everyone knew to keep below the cloud line. Above it, they warned, lived a dragon—an ancient creature, fierce and powerful. But Ellis was curious. One misty morning, against all advice, she decided to climb past the familiar trails. <br> <br>

As she reached the cloud-shrouded heights, a deep rumble stopped her in her tracks. She turned a corner and found herself face to face with the dragon. It was immense, its scales a muted green, blending into the mountainside like moss on stone. Its eyes held her in a steady, calculating gaze. <br> <br>

“Why are you here?” it asked, its voice a deep murmur that seemed to come from the mountain itself. <br> <br>

Ellis swallowed her fear and answered honestly, “I wanted to see if you were real.” <br> <br>

The dragon tilted its head, a wisp of smoke curling from its nostrils. “Curiosity is a bold reason to risk your life,” it replied. But it didn’t move to harm her. <br> <br>

Instead, that encounter turned into an unspoken pact. Over the next few months, Ellis returned often, bringing food and listening to the dragon’s stories of the world before hers. In turn, she shared village tales of ordinary lives, of seasons and harvests. A strange, mutual respect grew, and though Ellis never told anyone about her visits, the village began to thrive mysteriously—no missing livestock, better harvests, fewer storms. <br> <br>

Ellis’s visits continued, a quiet bond between her and the creature in the clouds, a pact unspoken but understood. <br> <br>
